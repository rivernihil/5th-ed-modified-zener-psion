# Introduction
Thank you for taking the time to look at this home-brew implementation of psionics for 5th edition.  The psion and adept classes inside use a form of psionic combat which was designed to be used in a world where psionics are ubiquitous, where virtually almost every intelligent creature has the ability to defend themselves psionically, and many also have methods to fight back or initiate psionic combat of their own.
<p>With this document you will find the following:</p>

 * The Psion: a ranged caster with many utility spells, similar in role to sorcerers, warlocks, or wizards
   * The Clairsentient: a psion subclass can predict the future, and gain extra sensory information
   * The Psychokineticist: a psion subclass that focuses on dealing ranged damage
   * The Telepath: a psion subclass focused on using powers that go directly mind to mind
 * The Adept: a light re-skin of the monk that uses PSI instead of KI, and gains some psionic powers like the psion
   * ???: a re-skinned Way of the Shadow subclass for usage with the adept
 * Rules for psionic combat
 * A psionic skill, similar to arcana or religion
 * Spell list and Spell conversions for psionic magic
 * A guide for alternatives to adapt the psion in a setting where psionics are not ubiquitous

<p>Additionally, this document is intended to be distributed with another document that contains a chart to aid usage of psionic combat, and cards to print for psionic combat.  I recommend printing out the main chart and putting a copy somewhere central so that all players can easily view it.  As for the cards, I'd recommend printing one set for the DM and another set for any psions, with maybe an additional set floating around for people that have any psionic defenses.  It should be pretty easy to make the specific cards you need.  I personally slip the paper into a card protector that has another card already in there (poker or magic works well for this).  This gives it a nice solidity.  I'm loosely toying with the idea of having some sets printed up.

#### Inspirations
I was chiefly inspired by the second edition psionics, which I made use of quite a bit in my youth.  Recently I begun to desire running a campaign in the DarkSun setting, and psionics was the first thing that jumped out at me as a blocking issue.  The UA mystic class did not really fit my needs, although I do hope to see an updated version of it at some point.
<p>Looking back on 2nd edition, one of the things that I loved most was the fiction of the different psionic attack and defense modes.  This love was further cemented by the excellent depictions of psionic combat in *The Verdant Passage*.  However, mechanically, those elements never really shined during play.  Furthermore, the psionicist class as a whole was generally overpowered, stronger than equivalent classes, while simultaneously containing lots of design traps.  Additionally, it also a pain in the butt to use and keep track of.  Luckily for the me, the excellent design of 5th edition has cleared things up a bit, and given me room to build the psionicist I always dreamed of.</p>
<p>Over the years, I marinated on those combat modes, and dreamed of marrying them with Zener cards.  The result is in this document.  Gone is the separation between attack and defense and power scores.  The cards provide a simple, fun rock-paper-scissors style of combat that, with my additions, I feel meshes nicely with core 5th edition mechanics.  The prevalence of psionics in the DarkSun setting led me to design psionic combat in a way that is fundamental to the gameplay at the table, and hopefully others will find it useful.  However, I completely understand that some will find this approach too heavy handed for their own games.</p>
<p>Additionally, I desired to clean up psionics a bit thematically.  The in-game fiction of psionics has drifted far from standard sci-fi and fantasy regarding psychic powers.  In my fiction, the things that can be accomplished by psionics is slightly more limited than what has been typical fare for D&D.</p>

# The Psion
Clad in a dark colored robe of the Tyrian bureaucracy, a bald and tattooed dwarf stares into the distance intently as he concentrates on the psionic defenses of King Kalak.  His psychic wards keep the king's most valuable treasures and secrets, hidden from those would otherwise wish to steal them and destroy his king.  The dwarf is paid well for expertise, and enjoys unheard of comfort, prestige, and security.  Still, the king knows that bought loyalty tends to have a short shelf-life, so he too keeps his mind's eye open, watching this one, and his other servants as well.
<p>An attractive fire Genasi walks down the city streets, passing vendor stalls, sometimes with a smile or a brief word.  Few realize his charms aren't completely natural: he uses his telepathic skill to influence those around him, giving a nudge here, and a tweak there to charm his way through life.  If he was more careful, he'd never want for anything, but sooner or later he's bound to cross the path of an even more powerful telepath, one who won't take kindly to his intrusions.</p>
<p>Unnatural wind and the pop and hiss of static electricity emanate from around a wild looking halfling, who floats down off a cliff while his hair blows wildly in the wind.  As explosions of psychokinetic energy go off, those below know that running is their only chance of survival, and if they scatter he might not be able to kill them all...</p>
<p>Psions are powerful individuals who have mastered the art of focusing the powers of their mind to shape reality.  While almost all beings on Athas possess some degree of psionic skill, not all have the talent or resources to dedicate their life to pursuing such skills.  Psions blast their foes with invisible forces, tear them to shreds, control the minds of others, cast their senses to far off places, and even glimpse into the otherwise unknowable future.</p>

### The Power of the mind
Psions use their natural talent to study and master psionics, the power of the mind.  For some rare savants, psionics comes naturally, as an extension of their very being.  But, for most, mastering the mind takes years of self-reflection, dedication, focus, and willpower.  Many psions seek to hone their talent to give them edge in surviving.  Some seek this power as it is one of the few opportunities for social-mobility that exists.  Others grow perversely attached to the power it presents to them, for indeed the power of the mind can be terrible to behold. Psions are one of two psionicist classes, the other being the adept who specializes in using their mind to control their body.

### The Will and the Way
Psionics on Athas are ubiquitous.  The power of psionics is commonly referred to as "the Will", and the self-examination necessary to master the Will is known as "the Way".  Although almost every intelligent being has some small talent with the Will, few have the patience to master the Way.
<p>In the harsh world of Athas, psionics allows those who would otherwise fail to survive to instead prosper.  Even the smallest halfling could contain enough power to destroy any foe, or allow a giant to communicate across the world.  Many nobles send their children to psionic academies, hoping that their scions will learn valuable skills which can help them maintain their precarious position in society.  Freeman too seek to send their gifted children to such academies, hoping that by doing so they can turn fortune in their favor, or at least ensure their children have lucrative work.  Street urchins find mentors, sometimes half-mad from their own studies, to teach them. Slaves teach each other tricks of the mind as a distraction, or to fulfill their wishes to escape.  No village or tribe can survive the wastes without a psionicist or two.  Although the skills of psionics are greatly aided by proper training, ultimately psionic power comes from an individuals directed effort to unlock their own mind, and not many have the willpower to persist in such endeavors.  Those who do could come from almost any background.</p>

### Creating A Psion
The most important question to answer when creating a psion is how you attained your psychic powers.  Was it a natural talent, or years of study?  Did you attend a school, and if so, how was it paid for?  Perhaps you studied under a mentor, such as hermit, or a tribal elder.
<p>Now that you have begun to finally master your psionic powers, what will you do with them?  Do you wish use your skill to gain fame and fortune, serving the lucrative merchant houses who are always looking out for skilled psions?  Or is the mastery of the mind a worthwhile pursuit in and of itself?  Maybe you have a score to settle with a school rival, perhaps a powerful noble family.  Perhaps the study of psionics comes so naturally to you that you cannot conceive of another path to follow.  You might decide that your powers give you easy access to things you want in life, and that psionic powers represent the natural order of life on Athas, where the strong dominate the weak.</p>

```
```

### Quick Build
You can make a psion quickly by following these suggestions.  First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom.  Second, choose any background.  Third, choose the following cantrips (in addition to the required *psychic probe*): *eldritch blast*, *mage hand*, and *friends*, along with the 1st-level spells *charm person* and *shield*.

## Class Features
As a psion, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
**Hit Dice**: 1d6 per psion level<br>
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 6 + your Constitution modifier<br>
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per psion level after 1st<br>

#### Proficiencies
**Armor:** Light Armor<br>
**Weapons:** Simple weapons<br>
**Tools:** None<br>
<br>
**Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Charisma<br>
**Skills:** Choose two from Culture, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Parapsychology, Perception, Persuasion

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

* (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon
* (a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) a scholar's pack
* Leather armor, any simple weapon, and two daggers

### Spell Casting
As a result of training with a mentor, attending a school, or through natural talent, you have the ability to cast psionic spells.  See the appropriate rules for casting spells in general, or your spell list at the end of the class description.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know 4 cantrips, one of which must be *psychic probe* and the remaining three are your choice from the psion spell list.  You learn additional psion cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Psion table.

#### PSI Points
The Psion table shows how many Psionic Points (PSI) you have available to cast your spells of 1st level or higher.  To cast one of these spells you must spend a number of PSI equal to the spell level of the spell being cast.  You regain all PSI when you finish a long rest.
<p>Some spells allow you to spend a greater amount of points for an additional effect, but you cannot spend a number of points greater than your Max Spell Level on one spell.</p>
<p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *magic missile*, have 3 PSI available, and your Max Spell Level is 2, you must spend 1 PSI to cast it, or you may instead spend 2 PSI to cast it for an additional effect, but you cannot yet spend all 3 PSI since your Max Spell Level is 2.</p>

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>Chapter 1 | The Psion</div>
\page

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You begin the game knowing 2 first level spells of your choice from the psion spell list.
<p>The Spells Known column of the Psion table shows when you learn more psion spells of your choice.  Each of these spells must be of a level less than or equal to the number shown in the Max Spell Level column.  For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the psion spells you know and replace it with another spell from the psion spell list, which also must be a level less than or equal to your Max Spell Level.</p>
<p>Although psions choose a discipline to focus on as their subclass options, they have access to the spell lists of all disciplines.</p>

#### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your psion spells, since the power of your mind is based your ability to understand the workings of your own mind, and focus your self-control and willpower.  You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.  In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psion spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.<br>
<div align="center">**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +<br>
your Charisma modifier</div>
<div align="center">**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus +<br>
your Charisma modifier</div>

#### Spellcasting Focus
Psionic spells do not require the caster to use a spellcasting focus.  Additionally, Psionic spells do not require Verbal, Somatic, or Material components.  However, psions do tend to exhibit either a look of intense focus, or a look of eyes closed concentration when casting psionic spells, which may alert those around to the potential of a psionic spell being cast.

### Psionic Recovery
You have learned the ability to recover some of your psychic energy by meditating.  When you finish a short rest, you can recover PSI equal to your half of your Max Spell Level, minimum of 1 PSI.
<p>For example, if you're a 4th level psion and you take a short rest, you can recover 1 PSI.</p>

### Psionic Discipline
When you reach 2nd level, choose a psionic discipline which describes the type of psionics which you desire to study or that you have a natural talent for: Clairsentience, Psychokinetics, or Telepathy, which are detailed at the end of the class description.  Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 2nd level, and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

```
```

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.  As normal, you cannot increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Psionic Attunement
At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will.  Choose a 1st-level psion spell and a 2nd-level psion spell from among those you know.  You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending PSI when you have them prepared.  If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend PSI as normal.
<p>By spending 8 hours in meditation, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.</p>

### Mental Mastery
When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort.  Choose two 3rd-level psion spells from among those you know as your mastered spells.  You always have these spells prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at their lowest level without expending PSI.  When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short rest.
<p>If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend PSI as normal.</p>

## Psionic Disciplines
According to some legends, psionics have been known on Athas since the first days of the world.  Whether or not this is true, the study of psionics is pervasive today.  There are two main categories of psionic traditions or sciences, those of the adept, focusing on the body, and those of the psion, focusing on the mind.
<p>The science that the psions use fall into 3 disciplines: Clairsentience, Psychokinesis, and Telepathy.  These three represent natural divisions in the focus of the mind that have evolved over the millennia.  Individual schools often specialize in one discipline, but unless there are other schools in the same area, they often cannot afford to neglect the other disciplines.  Outside of the schools, powerful mentors tend to attract and teach students who follow the same discipline.  Even natural talents focus on one of these disciplines, as the division of the disciplines ultimately reflects the underlying natural contours of the mind.  However, true mastery of the mind involves learning aspects of all three disciplines, and some mental techniques are common to more than one discipline.</p>

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>
<div class='footnote'>Chapter 1 | The Psion</div>
\page

### Clairsentience
The psionic discipline of clairsentience entails using the power of the mind to gain knowledge that would otherwise be unavailable to an individual's senses.  This ability generally ranges from simple enhancements of the normal senses, to the ability to cast the mind outside of the body, and even the power to peer into the future.  Clairsentients are highly valued for their skills which can easily shifts the tides of fortunes in the favor of those they support.
<p>Additionally, clairsentients gain knowledge of the weaknesses of the skills and techniques that clairsentients rely upon, and thus are often able to protect valuable secrets from prying minds.</p>

#### Preternatural Insight
Starting at 2nd level, you can glimpse into the near future and detect the psionic mode of your opposition during a psionic clash.  After losing a psionic clash, instead you can retroactively change your psionic mode to a different mode that you know.  You can use this ability once per short rest.

#### Manifold Knowledge
Beginning at 6th level, casting clairsentient spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your psionic power.  After casting a spell in the clairsentience discipline, you regain 1 less PSI than the level of the spell cast, up to a maximum of 5.

#### Precognition
Starting at 10th level, you can spend your contact to turn any attack roll, ability check, or savings throw relating to that creature from a success to a failure, or vice versa.  You may use this ability once per short rest.

#### Mind's Eye
Starting at 14th level, you can use both Preternatural Insight and Precognition twice per short rest, instead of once.

### Psychokinesis
The least subtle of the psionic disciplines, psychokineticists use the power of their minds to directly create fields of force to move existing objects, attack their foes, and generate protective shields.  No Tyrant's army would be complete without a company of dedicated psychokineticists blasting apart their foes, and they are feared across the land for their awesome power.

#### Empowered Blasting
Starting at 2nd level, when you cast *eldritch blast*, add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit.

#### Kinetic Shield
Starting at 6th level, when you cast *shield* as a reaction, after gaining the +5 bonus for the triggering attack, you may dismiss the remaining duration to cause *shield* to additionally gain the effect of *eldritch blast* targeting the source of the original triggering attack.

```
```

#### Burst of Willpower
Starting at 10th level, you can spend your contact to cast *eldritch blast* on that creature as a bonus action.  Additionally, whenever you cast *eldritch blast* you may pay 1 PSI to enter into a psionic clash with one of its targets.

#### Mind Over Matter
Starting at 14th level, you gain the ability to cast or dismiss *levitation* as an action.  This version of *levitation* has no duration.

### Telepathy
Perhaps the most iconic of the psionic disciplines is Telepathy.  Telepathy involves using one's mind to interface directly with that of another's.  This can be used for simple communication, but nearly everyone is afraid of the terrors of mind control.  Criminals often complain that they were under the effects of telepathic domination, but unless this can be proved, such claims are meaningless.  

#### Telepathic Field
Starting at 2nd level, when an ally within 60' of you enters into a psionic clash, you may use your reaction to take their place instead.

#### Split Brain
Starting a 6th level, when you cast *psionic probe*, you may target an additional creature.  At 10th level you may target 3 creatures, and at 14th level you may target 4 creatures.

#### Native Telepath
Starting at 6th level, you can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see or any willing creature you are aware of as long as you are on the same plane of existence.  You don't need to share a language with that creature, but it must be able to understand at least one language.

#### Memory Manipulation
Starting at 10th level, when you use a telepathic spell on a creature, you may spend the contact to prevent them from remembering anything from the initiation of contact until the spell ends.  While spellbound, if significant changes in their environment occur, they may realize that they have been charmed when the spell ends, and depending on the events leading up to the point of contact they may be able to surmise who was responsible, but they will otherwise have no direct memory of their time spent under the effects of the spell.

#### Telepathic Dominion
Starting at 14th level, as a bonus action, you can spend your contact to attempt to dominate that creature without paying any additional PSI.  That creature makes a Wisdom savings throw, and if it fails it is charmed by you and must follow your commands for up to 10 minutes, or as long as you maintain concentration on this effect.  It makes additional Wisdom saving throws whenever it takes damage, and otherwise this effect behaves like the appropriate *dominate beast/monster/person* spell.  You may use this ability once per short rest.

# Adept
Three descriptions here.

### Note: Adapting the adept
The Adept is a very light modification of the monk class.  Primarily this modification takes simply alters some of the fictional aspects of the monk.  Many of the changes are simply changes to the name of one ability or another.  Some changes involve swapping out spells of equal level with those that fill a similar role from the Psion spell list.  One substantial change I made to the class involves giving them increased to psionic modes compared to other non-psionic classes.  Additionally I added one psionic cantrip (*psychic probe*) to their abilities, which I feel does not alter their abilities noticeably.
<p>The existing monk class in 5th edition derives most of its fictional power from enhanced focus and training that is, generally speaking, not incompatible with the fiction of psionics.  One major exception to this exists which is the monk subclass Way of the Four Elements.  Based on my conception of psionics, elemental style magic is strictly off limits.  This shouldn't be too big of a deal since the Four Elements subclass is generally considered sub-par.

### Body and Mind
Some descriptions here.

# Psionic Combat
Psionic combat is intended to a fun and unique system to engage your players with and lies at the heart of the fun of playing a psionicist (any character that has specific psionic powers, e.g. a psion or adept). Creating a unique system was essential to making the psion feel like more than just another type of wizard. Psionic combat involves 3 distinct parts that operate together:  psionic modes, psionic clashes, and contact.  To assist with this, I have provided a separate PDF that contains an info sheet displaying quickly how to resolve psionic clashes, as well another sheet which contains images that can be cut out and used as cards to allow those in psionic combat to quickly and easily choose their modes.

### Psionic Modes
Psionic modes represent training in a specific style of thought structure.  As two telepaths engage in a contest of will, without a psionic mode to support their individual thoughts, the two minds would simply merge together briefly, and any motivations to enter into the contest in the first place get lost in the confusion.  Psionic modes provide a mechanism for the individuals involved to retain some elements of their identity during the struggle.
<p>Psions and adepts both gain psionic modes as part of leveling.  Additionally, they have a primary mechanism *psychic probe* to generate psionic clashes, although other methods may exist.</p>
<p>Depending on the level of integration of psionics into your world, you have different approaches for integrating psionic modes, and dealing with psionic clashes, for non-psionic characters.  For example, in my world which is based in the DarkSun setting where psionics are extremely prevalent, I have chosen to give all players two psionic modes to start with.  For non-psionic classes, they will start with two modes randomly (psions and adepts can choose their modes).  These characters are expected to frequently come into contact with psionic wielding enemies and should have some measure of defense against them.  However, non-psionic characters do not start with any abilities that allow them to generate psionic clashes, so their modes are for defense purposes only. If those non-psionic players wish to further engage with psionics, they must then either multi-class or pick up a feat which extends their psychic capabilities.</p>
<p>Consider a different approach: imagine a world where psionics are extremely rare.  In such a case, I would not give non-psionic characters any modes at all.  This has ramifications for how the psionic clashes below are resolved, and you will need to choose a method there that you are comfortable with.</p>
<p>There are seven psionic modes detailed below.</p>

#### Ego Projection
Represented by the **plus** symbol, *ego projection* is an enhanced version of our ordinary sense of self and rationality, magnified to an extreme.  This can have the effect of avoiding the confusion that some modes .

```
```

#### Empty Mind
Represented by the **circle** symbol, *empty mind* clears the mind of all activity.  This generally has the effect of pulling the ground out beneath some of the more aggressive modes, but can be weak against other forms of disruptions.

#### Feedback Loop
Represented by the **spiral** symbol, *feedback loop* creates an echo chamber in the mind that amplifies incoming signals.  These mental feedback loops can cause some modes to attack themselves, but *feedback loop* works best on modes that do not present a strong signal and are thus unprepared for what *feedback loop* can generate.

#### Id Insinuation
Represented by the **star** symbol, *id insinuation* creates a flood of repressed emotive urges from the base of the mind.  Many modes find these urges distracting and thus are prone to falter.

#### Iron Will
Represented by the **square** symbol, *iron will* steels a current frame of mind against change.  Modes that attempt such changes find that they are unable to do so.

#### Kinetic Burst
Represented by the **burst** symbol, *kinetic burst* attempts to use psychokinetic powers to warp and deform the brain itself.  Since the user of this mode must apply these shakes to their own mind, they are not powerful enough to do any real damage, but this shaking can create disorienting effects against some other modes.

#### Synaptic Static
Represented by the **three wavy lines** symbol, *synaptic static* is halfway between a psychokinetic art and a telepathic one, as it creates a buzzing field within the mind inhibiting the formation of normal thought patterns.  This is strong against modes that operate at lower levels of thought.

### Psionic Clashes
A psionic clash is a contest between two opposing psionic characters, specifically it tends to occur when telepathy is involved. Every psionic spell that requires contact initiates a psionic clash if the caster has not already established contact against the target and if that target is unwilling.  If the target is willing to undergo the effects of a telepathic spell, contact is considered to exist for the purposes of that spell.
<p>Whoever wins the psionic clash establishes contact with the target.  If, during the casting of a spell requiring contact, a psionic clash occurs and the spell caster does not win, the spell fails and the caster spends their action, however they do not pay the PSI cost for this attempted spell. Additionally, the *psionic probe* cantrip's primary purpose is to generate a psionic clash, although it does have an effect if contact has already been made.  Finally the psychokineticist's ability *burst of will* can be used to create a psionic clash.
<p>During a psionic clash, each character's controller selects, in secret, one of their available psionic modes.  When the controllers are ready, the modes are revealed, and resolved.  Optionally, to speed things up, any rolls that would need to be made as a result of success should be done at this time.</p>
<p>To resolve the psionic clash, see the second pdf for a visual chart for a chart that easily shows who wins and who loses.  But to briefly describe it you can follow the below mechanism.  A given mode will beat the three modes to the right of it on the following list, and lose to the three prior to it.  The end of the list wraps around to the front of the list to form a circular structure.  If a mode is pitted against itself no victory or loss takes place (and thus no contact is established).  Here is the resolution order:</p>
  
   * *feedback loop* → *kinetic burst* → *synaptic static* → *empty mind* → *iron will* → *id insinuation* → *ego projection* →
  
<p>For example, if during a clash the two modes revealed are *ego projection* and *synaptic static*, the character using *ego projection* would win.  If that player had instead picked *iron will*, then the player who used *synaptic static* would win the contest.</p>
<p>Among the participants, whoever is the winner of the psionic clash establishes contact against the loser.</p>
<p>Advantage and disadvantage.  This can easily be done for psionic clashes by having the advantaged party choosing two modes instead of one, then using whichever one is most advantageous.  In general I probably try to avoid this happening too often in my games, as someone who smartly chooses their modes has a fairly large advantage at this point.</p>
<p>Optional rule to speed things up for large groups (for example if a telepathic spell hits several targets).  Choose how many groups are affected, it could be 1 group that includes everybody, or it could be several groups of similar creatures.  The point here is to avoid doing a clash for each individual creature.  Then, for each group chosen in the above method, have the caster choose one mode to attack with.</p>

```
```

### Contact
Contact is a condition that represents the psychic influence of one individual over another.  In the language of contact, there are two parties involved.  The *contacter* is the individual who posses influence over the other.  The *contactee* is the individual who is subject to that influence.  When the condition occurs, the contacter is said to *establish contact* against the contactee.  That contact may later be *spent*, i.e. the condition is removed by some ability the contacter has that allows them to do so.
<p>Contact can be used to cause a moment of hesitation or distraction in the contactee.  At any time, the contacter may spend the contact to give the contacter advantage on any one attack roll, savings throw, or ability check where the contactee is involved.  Similarly, it may be spent to give the contactee disadvantage on any one attack roll, savings throw, or ability check where the contacter is involved.</p>
<p>Most telepathic spells require contact.  If that character already has established contact with the target, then that contact is spent.  However, if the character does not have contact, they have the opportunity to enter into a psionic conflict.  If they win, the contact is spent on the spell.  If the caster does not win the conflict, the action is failed, but no PSI points are spent.  Telepathic spells that require contact and otherwise specify an attack roll, savings throw or ability check are instead automatically successful.</p>
<p>The contact condition cannot be applied from the same contacter to the same contactee more than once simultaneously.  Contact has no requirement of PSI or concentration to maintain, but if the contacter is not within 60' of the contactee for more than a minute, the condition is removed.</p>

# Adapting Psionics

## Psionics in a non-psionic world
When trying to integrate the psion and adept into a world where psionics is not ubiquitous, there are some significant challenges.  This class is built around frequent usage of the model of psionic combat provided.  Without psionic combat, a lot of the reason to play with psionics is lost.  Additionally, if too many changes to psionic combat are made, many of the subclasses lose their value.  While you could home-brew them to fix those issues, in my opinion you are better off using a lightly re-skinned version of the sorcerer or wizard, and just position it fictionally as a psionicist.  However, I was able to come up with one approach which I think allows the class to function in a way that:
  * psionic players have fun with psionic combat and the class as written
  * non-psionic players aren't put off by it
  * and DMs do not need to do a lot of prep or background work in order to run it
    
Here is the rule:
<div class='descriptive'>
  When a non-psionic character enters into a psionic clash, their untrained mind naturally forms one of the seven psionic modes at random, that character's controller should pick a mode at random from the list of all available modes for every clash they enter into.  However, if the non-psionicist wins the psionic clash, they do not establish contact with the psionicist as normal because only those with some psionic skill are capable of doing so.
</div>

This rule does make psionic combat a little more difficult for the psionic participant.  This is because they can no longer look at past behavior of their opponent to predict their future behavior.  This is alleviated mostly by the fact that they never have give contact to the non-psionicist.

### Spell-casting ability
I chose charisma for my setting, but this could easily be wisdom as well.  In my setting Warlocks use intelligence, and there are no bards or paladins, so I felt like I needed another charisma based class to round things out.  Thematically, charisma does fit with the manipulative nature of telepathic spells.  On the other hand, "Willpower" as a savings throw is more closely related to wisdom, and allows it to fit together more in line with the monk, who also uses wisdom.

# Supplementary Rules

## Multi-classing
Something here.

## Skills
The skill sections above for the psion and adept make reference to the *culture* and *parapsychology* skills.  In my home-brew version of DarkSun, the *history* and *religion* skills are not present, and culture has filled the gap they left behind.  If you are using this psionics home-brew in a world where those are present, it would be fitting to swap *culture* for *history*.

Additionally, I have created a *parapsychology* skill to function as an analogue of *arcana* for wizards and *religion* for clerics.  Although its function should be pretty obvious, I will provide its definition here.
<br>
<br>
<p>***Parapsychology.*** Your Intelligence (Parapsychology) check measures your ability to recall lore about psionics, psionic items, symbols, monsters, and traditions, and the function of the mind, and the interpretation of dreams.</p>
<br>
<p>If you wish to avoid introducing another skill to your game, this material could reasonably be handled with the *arcana* skill.</p>
